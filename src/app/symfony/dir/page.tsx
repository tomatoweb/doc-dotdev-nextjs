â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ file1.php
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ file2.php
â””â”€â”€ index.php

If we do include "inc/file1.php" from index.php it will work. 

However, from file1.php to include file2.php we must do an 
include relative to index.php and not from file1.php

So, include "file2.php" from file1.php will not work.
__DIR__ fixes this, so from file1.php we can do this:

include __DIR__ . "/file2.php";

__DIR est le dossier de file1 par rapport Ã  index.php`;

      the current script is index.php, thus the path ../shop/file2.php is wrong.

      <Typography variant="body1" sx={{fontWeight: 500, marginBottom:4}}>
      To fix this, we add __DIR__ to this path :

      <Image
        width={0}
        height={0}
        sizes="100vw"
        style={{width: '100%', height: 'auto'}} 
        className="h-auto rounded-lg" 
        src="/dir1.png" 
        alt=""
      />
      <Typography variant="h6" sx={{fontWeight: 500, marginBottom:4}}>
      In most cases it is used to include another file from an included file
